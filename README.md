# 8-queens-in-C
Solving 8 queens problem with the C programming language


## performance
(On my personal laptop Thinkpad x1 carbon with i7-10710u CPU.)

It can solve X   queens in      Y seconds

             X                  Y

             200000             0.04

             500000             0.09 
             
             1000000            0.274

             2000000            0.924

             5000000            3.312


When N(the number of queens) is not very large,this algorithm is approximately linear.
