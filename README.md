# N-queens-in-C
Solving N queens problem (Just find one possible solution, not all situations) with the C programming language
-- with high speed

**⚠️️ Warning: I use some Heuristics Algorithm in this code to get a better performance when N is very large. However these Algorithm may cause a worse performance when N is small.  So DON'T try small number.**

## performance
(On my personal laptop Thinkpad x1 carbon with i7-10710u CPU.)

It can solve X   queens in      Y seconds
